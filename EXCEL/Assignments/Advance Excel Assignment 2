1.	What does the dollar ($) sign do?
Ans : When the dollar sign ($) is placed before the column letter and/or row number in a cell reference, it creates an absolute reference. This means that when a formula or reference is copied to other cells, the referenced column or row remains fixed.

2.	How to Change the Reference from Relative to Absolute (or Mixed)?
Ans: 
To make the column reference absolute, place a dollar sign before the column letter.
To make the row reference absolute, place a dollar sign before the row number.
To create a mixed reference, use the dollar sign for either the column or row part of the reference.

Lookup_value: The value you want to look up. 
Table_array: The range of cells in which the VLOOKUP will search for the lookup_value and the return value.
